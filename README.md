Using the One Dark scheme as a starter, this colour scheme uses the colours of the thistle; the National Flower of Scotland.

I was doing some work on a site for a Framer Meetup in Scotland and I like the palette so much I thought I'd have a go at making a code colour scheme.

The colours are bright and high contrast (for the most part) and are set up for CSS, HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.

This is still a work in progress so if you decide to use it and can think of improvements let me know.
