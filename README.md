# thistle-sublime-colorscheme
Using the One Dark scheme as a starter, this slightly different colour scheme uses the colours of Scotland’s national flower.

(Basically I was doing some work on the Framer Scotland site - coming soon - and like the colours so much I thought I’d have a go at making a colour scheme)

The colours are bright and high contrast (for the most part) and is scheme is set up for CSS, HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.

This is still a WIP so if you decide to use it and can think of some suggestions to improve it let me know.
